Solution/Issues
==========

This project was a challenge.  One of the issues I was working with was trying to install logstash properly for some reason I had the wrong logstash file and kept getting an error when trying to run it.  I looked and analyzed the information input coming from the log file.  Tried to use a file plugin to get the logs.  Did a little reasearch and saw maybe the grok filter might be the right one to help me.  For the output tried to use elasticsearch and kibana checked the value but kept getting a blank screen for some reason.  Tried to figure out that I think I'm missing something.
